# notes on the making of monsweeper

- this is tricky!
- modeling a text-based game as a visual one
- N.B. children created by a list in JSX must have a key property
- N.B. inline styling in JSX isn't one-to-one with HTML
- my plan is as such:
    - render a 3x3 grid, hardcoded size for now
    - each cell in the grid either has an electrode or doesnt
    - undecided how i'll handle the battle sequence
        - can go the new page route
        - or can do a modal
    - there is a dpad at the bottom
- setting up the grid was a pain but i did it
    - i had to do everything within the useState callback function
    - i cant use useEffect because eslint doesnt like it
        - i was referencing the grid state variable
    - state is managed in the grid and not the individual cells
        - which makes sense now that i think about it
        - single source of truth ... single source of truth
- what comes next is setting up the player and implementing movement
- i imagine that i will need a wrapper component (called game or something)
  that manages state that can be passed between the controller and the grid
    - i also need to figure out what it means to be a player
    - and where the player starts
        - does the user get to decide or is it random
- the buttons are done now
    - i need to now translate that to something visual
    - how do i represent the user visually? how do i represent the electrodes (once found)?
        - going to start by bundling in a boolean variable in for the cell
            - this will denote user presence
            - will make it easy to check for battle conditions too
        - cell is disjoint from turn
            - the current space is linked to a cell's space
- stumped trying to link user presence based on the current space
    - the useEffect is tricky stuff!
    - the solution was to create a new object at the second level
        - this is what i was doing for the turn operations too
        - i didn't know that you could do that in js
        - essentially, you create a new object using a spread operator, then can override values
            - in this case, i wanted to override with the value of the userPresent property
            - i end up overriding all of the properties, but only one should change
- i got user movement working
    - what happened was that userPresent was always false
    - this was because i was comparing current space and the cell space
    - cell space was incremented by one for display purposes, so i needed to handle that in the conditional
